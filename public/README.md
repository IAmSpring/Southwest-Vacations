## Deployment

This application is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages through GitHub Actions workflows. Each commit to the main branch triggers a deployment pipeline that builds and publishes the application.

### GitHub Pages Hosting

The application is hosted on GitHub Pages at the repository's designated URL. The Vite configuration in `vite.config.ts` is set up to handle proper base paths for GitHub Pages hosting:

```javascript
const repositoryName = 'Southwest-Vacations';
const base = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? `/${repositoryName}/` : '/';
```

### Continuous Deployment

Two GitHub Actions workflows manage the deployment process:

1. **Main Deployment Workflow**:

   - Triggered on pushes to the main branch
   - Builds the application with production settings
   - Configures GitHub Pages environment
   - Uploads build artifacts
   - Deploys to GitHub Pages

2. **Manual Deployment**:
   - Can be triggered manually via `workflow_dispatch`
   - Useful for deploying specific versions or when automatic deployment is paused

### Environment Handling

For security, the workflows use GitHub Secrets to inject environment variables during the build process. This keeps sensitive information like API keys secure while allowing the application to access necessary services.

### Accessing the Deployed Application

The deployed application is available at:

- Production: [https://iamspring.github.io/Southwest-Vacations/](https://iamspring.github.io/Southwest-Vacations/)
- For each successful deployment, the GitHub Actions job will provide a link to the deployed version in the workflow summary.

### Manual Testing Scripts

Below are manual testing scripts you can use to verify the application works as expected:

#### 1. Authentication Testing

```bash
# Register a new user
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/users/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"testuser","email":"test@example.com","password":"Password123"}'

# Login with the registered user
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/users/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"Password123"}'

# Get user profile (copy the token from the login response)
curl -X GET http://localhost:4000/users/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```

#### 2. Trip Search and Filtering

```bash
# Get all trips
curl -X GET http://localhost:4000/trips

# Get a specific trip
curl -X GET http://localhost:4000/trips/trip1

# Search trips by destination
curl -X GET "http://localhost:4000/trips/search?destination=Hawaii"

# Filter trips by price range
curl -X GET "http://localhost:4000/trips/search?minPrice=1000&maxPrice=2000"
```

#### 3. Booking Management

```bash
# Create a booking (requires authentication)
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/bookings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -d '{
    "tripId": "trip1",
    "fullName": "Test User",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "travelers": 2,
    "startDate": "2025-08-01"
  }'

# Get user's bookings
curl -X GET http://localhost:4000/bookings/user \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"

# Get booking details (replace BOOKING_ID with an actual booking ID)
curl -X GET http://localhost:4000/bookings/BOOKING_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"

# Cancel a booking
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:4000/bookings/BOOKING_ID/cancel \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```

#### 4. Favorites Testing

```bash
# Add a trip to favorites
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/favorites \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -d '{"tripId": "trip2"}'

# Get user's favorites
curl -X GET http://localhost:4000/favorites \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"

# Remove from favorites (replace FAVORITE_ID with an actual favorite ID)
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:4000/favorites/FAVORITE_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
```

### Testing with Postman

A Postman collection is included in the `tests/postman` directory. Import the collection into Postman to quickly test all endpoints.

To use the collection:

1. Import `Southwest_Vacations_API.postman_collection.json` into Postman
2. Set up an environment with variables:
   - `baseUrl`: http://localhost:4000
   - `authToken`: (Will be set automatically after login)
3. Run the collection in sequence, starting with authentication

### Database Verification

To verify data is being stored properly, check the `data/db.json` file. This file contains all the application data and is updated in real-time.

## System Testing

### System Check Tool

The application includes a system check tool for verifying that the frontend and backend are properly connected and authentication is working correctly. This is useful for diagnosing issues during setup or after making changes.

To use the system check:

1. Navigate to the `/system-check` route in your browser
2. Click "Run System Check" to verify:
   - Backend connectivity
   - Authentication flow
   - Booking functionality

You can also run a basic system check from the command line:

```bash
# Run the system check utility
npm run system-test

# Check only if services are running
npm run system-test -- --check

# Open the system check in browser
npm run system-test -- --view
```

The system check will verify that:

- The backend API is reachable and responding
- Authentication endpoints are working correctly
- You can successfully log in and get a valid token
- The booking flow is functional with proper authentication

If you encounter the "Authentication required" error when trying to book a trip, use the system check to verify that your authentication is working properly.

## üöÄ GitHub Pages Deployment

This project is set up for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions workflows. Here's how the deployment process works:

### Continuous Deployment Flow

1. **Code Push Triggers Workflow**:

   - Any push to the `main` branch automatically triggers the GitHub Actions workflow
   - The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

2. **Build Process**:

   - The workflow checks out the latest code
   - Sets up Node.js 18 with npm caching
   - Installs dependencies via `npm ci`
   - Builds the application using `npm run build`
   - This generates optimized static files in the `dist` directory

3. **GitHub Pages Configuration**:

   - The workflow configures GitHub Pages settings
   - Uploads the build artifacts from `dist`
   - Deploys the content to the GitHub Pages environment

4. **Base Path Configuration**:
   - The Vite configuration in `vite.config.ts` automatically handles the GitHub Pages base path:
   ```javascript
   const repositoryName = 'Southwest-Vacations';
   const base = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? `/${repositoryName}/` : '/';
   ```
   - This ensures all assets and routes work correctly when deployed

### Viewing the Deployed Application

The live application can be accessed at:

- [https://iamspring.github.io/Southwest-Vacations/](https://iamspring.github.io/Southwest-Vacations/)

### Manual Deployment

If needed, you can manually trigger the deployment workflow:

1. Go to the GitHub repository
2. Navigate to "Actions" tab
3. Select the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
4. Click "Run workflow" and select the branch to deploy

### Jekyll Configuration

The repository also includes Jekyll configuration via `_config.yml`:

```yaml
domain: iamspring.github.io
url: https://iamspring.github.io
baseurl: /home
```

This enables GitHub Pages to properly serve the application with the correct paths and settings.

### Deployment Status

After each push to the main branch:

1. Check the "Actions" tab in the GitHub repository to monitor build status
2. A successful deployment will show a green checkmark
3. The deployment URL will be available in the workflow summary
